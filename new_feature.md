**Idea:**
Just tired to get it to make me a perfect, pretty website. The results were... not perfect.
What I have drawn form this is that chat is really really bad at problem solving beyond the initial layout and edevelopment of th website. Seeing as how this was was finally brok chat for me after several failed attempts, this seemed like intresting information to submit for your consideration of the limits of chat.

It seems to be able to handle very basic descriptions very well. Index 1 is good proof of this. Index 2 is the first time I tried to add more detailed information into my prompt. it failes at being perfect here, ALWAYS. nothing I tried worked and I needed to revert several times. Index 3 is the best I could get out of t chat.

**Conculsions:**

Chat is a misserably not a high achiver. If I asked any of my classmates to send me a perfect recreation of this website for $240, I'd be willing to bet I'd have a perfect model withing a month. For reference, chat costs $240/y as of 01/30/2025.

As a result, if you ask chat to do something perfectly using an image as a reference, it seems like it will never take you 100% of the way there. This means there will need to be some user tweaking to complete the design of this website.
